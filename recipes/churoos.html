        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup margarine</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p> In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, 
                heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). 
                Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. 
                Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. 
                Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. 
                Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. 
                Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. 
                Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. 
                Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. 
                Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
